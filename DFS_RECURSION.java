Depth–first search in trees
A tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by exactly one path. 
In other words, any acyclic connected graph is a tree. For a tree, we have the following traversal methods:

Preorder: visit each node before its children.
Postorder: visit each node after its children.
Inorder (for binary trees only): visit left subtree, node, right subtree.
Implementing DFS in Java | Depth First Search Algorithm

->A Depth–first search (DFS) is a way of traversing graphs closely related to the preorder traversal of a tree. 
Following is the recursive implementation of preorder traversal:

procedure preorder(treeNode v)
{
    visit(v);
    for each child u of v
        preorder(u);
}


To turn this into a graph traversal algorithm, replace “child” with “neighbor”. 
But to prevent infinite loops, keep track of the vertices that are already discovered and not revisit them.

procedure dfs(vertex v)
{
    visit(v);
    for each neighbor u of v
        if u is undiscovered
            call dfs(u);
}

The time complexity of DFS traversal is O(V + E), where V and E are the total number of vertices and edges in the graph, respectively. 
Please note that O(E) may vary between O(1) and O(V2), depending on how dense the graph is.
