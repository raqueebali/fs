/*
You are given two strings s and t.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to t.

 

Example 1:
Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
Output: "e"
Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.

Example 2:
Input: s = "", t = "y"
Output: "y"

Procedue:
using Hash Table:
Use count array to store the frequency of character, increase for string s and decrease t
Loop from letter a to z, the first encounter of count = 1 is our answer


Using Sum:
Similar to above, we add the character from s and deduct the character from t
The final sum is the character



case=1
input=
abcd
abcde

output=
e
